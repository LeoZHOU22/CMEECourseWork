\section*{Introduction}
We analyze the temperature trend in Florida using annual data from Key West during the 20th century.

\section*{Method}
We calculated the correlation coefficient between years and temperature to gauge the trend. Given the temporal nature of the data, we used a permutation approach by reshuffling the temperatures and recalculating the correlation coefficient 10,000 times.

\section*{Results}
\input{florida_results.csv}

\section*{Conclusion}
Based on our analysis, \textbf{(interpretation based on p-value)}: for instance, if the p-value is less than 0.05, the trend in temperature is statistically significant, suggesting Florida is indeed getting warmer.
