Week 1
=============

Description
-----------

This week 1 repository contains resources and examples for using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to write and execute shell scripts and to create and compile LaTeX documents.

Getting Started
---------------

### Prerequisites

*   **Visual Studio Code**: Ensure you have Visual Studio Code installed on your system. If not, you can download it from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
*   **Git**: To clone this repository, you need Git installed. Download it from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if necessary.
*   **LaTeX**: For compiling LaTeX documents, a LaTeX distribution like TeX Live or MiKTeX is required. Install from [TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive/) or [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/).
*   **Shell**: For running shell scripts, ensure you have a Unix-like environment if on Windows (e.g., WSL, Cygwin) or use the native terminal on macOS or Linux.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git`.
2.  **Open in VS Code**: Open the cloned directory in Visual Studio Code.

### Setting Up Visual Studio Code

*   **Shell Scripting Extensions**: Install extensions for shell scripting, such as 'ShellCheck' or 'Bash IDE' for enhanced syntax highlighting and linting.
*   **LaTeX Extensions**: Install a LaTeX extension like 'LaTeX Workshop' for LaTeX support in VS Code. This extension provides features like build automation, PDF preview, and more.

Usage
-----

### Writing Shell Scripts

*   Create a new file with a `.sh` extension.
*   Write your shell script. VS Code provides syntax highlighting and suggestions.
*   To run the script, use the integrated terminal in VS Code.

### Writing LaTeX Documents

*   Create a new file with a `.tex` extension.
*   Write your LaTeX document. The 'LaTeX Workshop' extension provides a rich set of tools for LaTeX editing and compiling.
*   Use the build feature of the LaTeX extension to compile the document into a PDF.
