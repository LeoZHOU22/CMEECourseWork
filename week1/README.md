Getting Started
Prerequisites

    Visual Studio Code: Ensure you have Visual Studio Code installed on your system. If not, you can download it from here.
    Git: To clone this repository, you need Git installed. Download it from here if necessary.
    LaTeX: For compiling LaTeX documents, a LaTeX distribution like TeX Live or MiKTeX is required. Install from TeX Live or MiKTeX.
    Shell: For running shell scripts, ensure you have a Unix-like environment if on Windows (e.g., WSL, Cygwin) or use the native terminal on macOS or Linux.

    Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git.
    Open in VS Code: Open the cloned directory in Visual Studio Code.

Setting Up Visual Studio Code

    Shell Scripting Extensions: Install extensions for shell scripting, such as 'ShellCheck' or 'Bash IDE' for enhanced syntax highlighting and linting.
    LaTeX Extensions: Install a LaTeX extension like 'LaTeX Workshop' for LaTeX support in VS Code. This extension provides features like build automation, PDF preview, and more.

Usage
Writing Shell Scripts

    Create a new file with a .sh extension.
    Write your shell script. VS Code provides syntax highlighting and suggestions.
    To run the script, use the integrated terminal in VS Code.

Writing LaTeX Documents

    Create a new file with a .tex extension.
    Write your LaTeX document. The 'LaTeX Workshop' extension provides a rich set of tools for LaTeX editing and compiling.
    Use the build feature of the LaTeX extension to compile the document into a PDF.

Examples

This repository includes some example files to get you started:

    example_script.sh: A simple shell script demonstrating basic shell operations.
    example_document.tex: A basic LaTeX document that showcases simple formatting and structure.
